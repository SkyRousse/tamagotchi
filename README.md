# Tamagotchi

In the early 2000's, Tamagotchis were all the rage. They were handheld, digital pets that could be carried around on keychain-sized mini computers. They required loving care by pressing buttons to feed them, play with them, and put them to sleep. If you didn't give a Tamagotchi enough food, attention or rest, it would...alas...die.

Time for you to make your own Tamagotchis! Think through how a Tamagotchi works. What properties does every Tamagotchi have when it is created? What levels will need to be maintained to care for your Tamagotchi? How will you manage the passing of time and the changing of those levels? How do those levels increase? When do they decrease? After brainstorming the behaviors you want to capture in your Tamagotchi game, get started writing specs for unit testing your class methods.

Here are some possible behaviors you may consider on your Tamagotchi class methods. As you work through this list, feel free to add additional types of interactions a user may have with their Tamagotchi, too.

Check on the pet and see how it's doing (is it still alive?!?)
* Feed it
* Play with it
* Put it to sleep
